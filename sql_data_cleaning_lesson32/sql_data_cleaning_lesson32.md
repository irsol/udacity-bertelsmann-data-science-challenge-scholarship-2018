## LEFT and RIGHT

LEFT pulls a specified number of characters for each row in a specified column starting at the beginning (or from the left). As you saw here, you can pull the first three digits of a phone number using LEFT(phone_number, 3).


RIGHT pulls a specified number of characters for each row in a specified column starting at the end (or from the right). As you saw here, you can pull the last eight digits of a phone number using RIGHT(phone_number, 8).


LENGTH provides the number of characters for each row of a specified column. Here, you saw that we could use this to get the length of each phone number as LENGTH(phone_number).
